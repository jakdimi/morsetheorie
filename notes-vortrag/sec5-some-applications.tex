\begin{theorem}
    \label{theorem:homeomorphic to Sn}
    If $M^n$ is a compact manifold that admits a morse function $f$ with 
    exactly two critical points, then $M$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[CW-Structure of Manifolds]
    \label{theorem:CW}
    If $M$ is a manifold that admits a morse function $f$, such that each $M^a$
    is compact, then $M$ has the homotopy-type of a CW-Complex with a 
    $\lambda$-cell for each critical point of $f$ of index $\lambda$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    Theorem~\ref{theorem:homeomorphic to Sn} follows immediately from
    theorem~\ref{theorem:CW}.
